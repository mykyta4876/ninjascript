Develop custom NinjaTrader Chart Trader.

I'm looking for a freelancer who recreate the current NinjaTrader Chart Trader.
We do not need to create ATM functionality.
But we need other functionalities.
We need to show the total max loss amount on the STOP LOSS order marker on the chart.
And the ability to show the max profit amount on the Target order marker on the chart.
I've source code of similar project and you can refer it.
If you're interested in it, please bid with your method how to develop it.
